This project explores the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and cybersecurity policies in the national and private sectors. We will survey and compare the policies at these levels.

## Research Goal

2. Compare the difference in methods and policies

## Method
1. Collect data from academic (articles, journals, etc.) or regulative sources (policy documents).
2. Analyze and compare the data from different countries and fields.

## Expected Results
After conducting this survey, we expect to conclude the differences of perspectives and integration of AI and Cybersecurity policies in different levels and fields.
