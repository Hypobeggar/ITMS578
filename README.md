# The Integration of Cybersecurity and AI Policies
This project explores the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and cybersecurity policies in the national and private sectors. We will survey and compare the policies at these levels.

## Research Goal
1. Understand the governance of AI at global and lower levels
2. Compare the difference in methods and policies

## Method
1. Collect data from academic (articles, journals, etc.) or regulative sources (policy documents).
2. Analyze and compare the data from different countries and fields.

## Expected Results
After conducting this survey, we expect to conclude the differences of perspectives and integration of AI and Cybersecurity policies in different levels and fields.
